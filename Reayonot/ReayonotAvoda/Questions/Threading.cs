         * Answers:
         *      1. What is a mutex?
         *      A mutex object is a synchronization object whose state is set to signaled when it is not owned by any thread, 
         *      and nonsignaled when it is owned. Only one thread at a time can own a mutex object, whose name comes from the 
         *      fact that it is useful in coordinating mutually exclusive access to a shared resource. For example, to prevent 
         *      two threads from writing to shared memory at the same time, each thread waits for ownership of a mutex object 
         *      before executing the code that accesses the memory. After writing to the shared memory, the thread releases the 
         *      mutex object.
         *      
         *      msdn for mutex example:
         *      https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.mutex(v=vs.110).aspx
         *      
         *      Simply put the mutex object is a type of object created that can resemble a gaurd post - it is created and then
         *      at any point a thread can activate it in a method to make sure all other threads stop at that post. once the
         *      mutex is released the next method can enter and so on.
         *      Of course mutex also has additional properties such as timeout where all methods trying to access it can be diverted
         *      elswhere in case enouph time has passed an so on.
         *      
         *      2.What is a semaphore?
         *      A semaphore for all purposes is almost the same thing as a mutex just that it restricts access using a counter
         *      determining the amount of threads that can pass it at a time (access its restricted content). 
         *      In other words, if a semaphore is started at zero and is given a max of three, at most three threads will be able
         *      to enter its restricted area at any given time (each thread that exits the semaphore will release its hold and
         *      allow a new thread to enter).
         *      
         *      2.*. What is the difference between mutex and semaphore?
         *      In this case the difference is simple, a semaphore can provide and dissallow access based on more than one thread - 
         *      as in, it has a counter where mutex can work with one thread owning it at a time.
         *      BUT - another question that can be asked is what is the difference between a mutex and a binary semaphore?
         *      A good answer is at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/62814/difference-between-binary-semaphore-and-mutex
         *      The gist of it is that the mutex has an owner, each time the mutex is taken control of it can be relinquished only
         *      by its owner (kind of like a talking stick where only the owner can say when they finished talking and pass it on
         *      to the manager so they can give it to the next person who wants to talk).
         *      A semaphore on the other hand can be accessed to be given or taken as needed between processess. 
         *      (TODO: understand a bit better when a semaphore can be transfered and why its a good idea).
         *      
         *      In windows a binary semaphore is very similare to an event.
         *         
         *      3.What is a critical section?
         *      A critical section is an area of code that's access must be limited in a multithreaded enviroment since concurrent
         *      access to the area might cause issues. In other words - the critical section is a delicate area of code that
         *      requires mutual exclusion or the codes outcome might do things you dont want it to do.
         *      
         *      A critical section may consist of multiple discontiguous parts of the program's code. For example, one part of 
         *      a program might read from a file that another part wishes to modify. These parts together form a single critical 
         *      section, since simultaneous readings and modifications may interfere with each other.
         * 
         *      A critical section will usually terminate in finite time,[1] and a thread, task, or process will have to wait for 
         *      a fixed time to enter it (aka bounded waiting). Some synchronization mechanism is required at the entry and exit 
         *      of the critical section to ensure exclusive use, for example a semaphore.
         *      
         *      The function lock(referencedObject){critical section} is an example of a critical section.
         *      The lock keyword ensures that one thread does not enter a critical section of code while another thread is 
         *      in the critical section. If another thread tries to enter a locked code, it will wait, block, until the object 
         *      is released.
         *      
         *      In general, avoid locking on a public type, or instances beyond your code's control. 
         *      The common constructs lock (this), lock (typeof (MyType)), and lock ("myLock") violate this guideline:
         *
         *      lock (this) is a problem if the instance can be accessed publicly.
         *      lock (typeof (MyType)) is a problem if MyType is publicly accessible.
         *      lock("myLock") is a problem because any other code in the process using the same string, will share the same lock.
         *      Best practice is to define a private object to lock on, or a private static object variable to protect data common 
         *      to all instances.
         * 
         *      3.*.What is the difference between a critical section and a mutex?
         *      For Windows, critical sections are lighter-weight than mutexes.
         *      Mutexes can be shared between processes, but always result in a system call to the kernel which has some overhead.
         *      Critical sections can only be used within one process, but have the advantage that they only switch to kernel mode
         *      in the case of contention - Uncontended acquires, which should be the common case, are incredibly fast. In the case
         *      of contention, they enter the kernel to wait on some synchronization primitive (like an event or semaphore).
         *      
         *      4.TPL
         *      Task Parallel Library
         *          4.a.What are tasks?
         *          Tasks are .NET managed threads. 
         *          The Task class represents a single operation that does not return a value and that usually executes 
         *          asynchronously.
         *          A task is started using the run function. In addition it has many other functions that work with it such
         *          as wait that provides the capability to wait for another task to complete, waiting for an amount of time, 
         *          synchronization and so forth, many of the threads methods are translated in practice to the task form.
         *          
         *          4.b.What is the difference between tasks and threads?
         *          Tasks are more efficient and more scalable use of system resources.
         *          Behind the scenes, tasks are queued to the ThreadPool, which has been enhanced with algorithms that 
         *          determine and adjust to the number of threads and that provide load balancing to maximize throughput. 
         *          This makes tasks relatively lightweight, and you can create many of them to enable fine-grained parallelism.
         *          
         *          Tasks provide more programmatic control than is possible with a thread or work item.
         *          Tasks and the framework built around them provide a rich set of APIs that support waiting, cancellation, 
         *          continuations, robust exception handling, detailed status, custom scheduling, and more.
         *          
         *          Like the ThreadPool, a task does not create its own OS thread. Instead, tasks are executed by a TaskScheduler; 
         *          the default scheduler simply runs on the ThreadPool.
         *          Unlike the ThreadPool, Task also allows you to find out when it finishes, and (via the generic Task<T>) to 
         *          return a result. You can call ContinueWith() on an existing Task to make it run more code once the task finishes.
         *          
         *          Since tasks still run on the ThreadPool, they should not be used for long-running operations, since they can 
         *          still fill up the thread pool and block new work. Instead, Task provides a LongRunning option, which will 
         *          tell the TaskScheduler to spin up a new thread rather than running on the ThreadPool.
         *          
         *          The bottom line is that Task is almost always the best option; it provides a much more powerful API and 
         *          avoids wasting OS threads.
         *          The only reasons to explicitly create your own Threads in modern code are setting per-thread options, or 
         *          maintaining a persistent thread that needs to maintain its own identity.
         *
         *          4.c.Tasks implement IDisposable, do you need to dispose of tasks?
         *          The short answer is -No.
         *          The longer answer is not unless you are having performace standards that you need to meet and are makeing
         *          1000000% sure that the tasks are no longer in use when you are disposing of them.
         *          The main reason Tasks implement IDisposable is because the contain IDisposable recourses and according to the
         *          .net framework guildlines this meens its better to also implement this in the parent.
         *          
         *      5.Threads
         *          5.a.Whats are threads?
         *          
         *          C# supports parallel execution of code through multithreading. A thread is an independent execution path, able
         *          to run simultaneously with other threads.
         *          
         *          Each thread has its own stack & kernal recources.
         *          
         *          Multiple threads can be created via a threadpool which is managed by the clr.
         *          The problem with Thread is that OS threads are costly. Each thread you have consumes a non-trivial amount of 
         *          memory for its stack, and adds additional CPU overhead as the processor context-switch between threads. 
         *          Instead, it is better to have a small pool of threads execute your code as work becomes available.
         *          
         *          5.b.What are issues that may occure with threads?     
         *          
         *          Improved performance and concurrency
         *              For certain applications, performance and concurrency can be improved by using multithreading and 
         *              multicontexting together. In other applications, performance can be unaffected or even degraded by 
         *              using multithreading and multicontexting together. How performance is affected depends on your application.
         *              
         *          Threads are very costly when it comes to memory and control. 
         *              Each thread has its own stack and recources and switching between threads can be expencive. The same can 
         *              be said for threadpools, even though they do provide a way to manage multiple threads more easily the main 
         *              drawback is the inability to control what happens when in what order and when its done + what it returns 
         *              (doesnt get the return values).
         *              
         *          Difficulty of writing code
         *             Multithreaded and multicontexted applications are not easy to write. Only experienced programmers should 
         *             undertake coding for these types of applications.
         *      
         *          Difficulty of debugging
         *              It is much harder to replicate an error in a multithreaded or multicontexted application than it is to do 
         *              so in a single-threaded, single-contexted application. As a result, it is more difficult, in the former 
         *              case, to identify and verify root causes when errors occur.
         *          
         *          Difficulty of managing concurrency
         *              The task of managing concurrency among threads is difficult and has the potential to introduce new problems 
         *              into an application.
         *          
         *          Difficulty of testing
         *              Testing a multithreaded application is more difficult than testing a single-threaded application because 
         *              defects are often timing-related and more difficult to reproduce.
         *          
         *          Difficulty of porting existing code
         *              Existing code often requires significant re-architecting to take advantage of multithreading and 
         *              multicontexting. Programmers need to:
         *                  Remove static variables
         *                  Replace any function calls that are not thread-safe
         *                  Replace any other code that is not thread-safe
         *              Because the completed port must be tested and re-tested, the work required to port a multithreaded and/or 
         *              multicontexted application is substantial.                   
         *          
         *          5.c.What are threads good for? What are they used for?
         *          
         *          Improved performance and concurrency
         *              For certain applications, performance and concurrency can be improved by using multithreading and 
         *              multicontexting together. In other applications, performance can be unaffected or even degraded by 
         *              using multithreading and multicontexting together. How performance is affected depends on your application.
         *              
         *           Simplified coding of remote procedure calls and conversations
         *              In some applications it is easier to code different remote procedure calls and conversations in separate 
         *              threads than to manage them from the same thread.
         *              
         *           Simultaneous access to multiple applications
         *              Your BEA Tuxedo clients can be connected to more than one application at a time.
         *
         *           Reduced number of required servers Because one server can dispatch multiple service threads the number 
         *           of servers to start for your application is reduced. 
         *              This capability for multiple dispatched threads is especially useful for conversational servers, which 
         *              otherwise must be dedicated to one client for the entire duration of a conversation.
         *          
         *          5.d.What is a threadpool?
         *          
         *          ThreadPool is a wrapper around a pool of threads maintained by the CLR. ThreadPool gives you no control at all;
         *          you can submit work to execute at some point, and you can control the size of the pool, but you can’t set 
         *          anything else. You can’t even tell when the pool will start running the work you submit to it.
         *          
         *          Using ThreadPool avoids the overhead of creating too many threads. However, if you submit too many long-running 
         *          tasks to the threadpool, it can get full, and later work that you submit can end up waiting for the earlier 
         *          long-running items to finish. In addition, the ThreadPool offers no way to find out when a work item has been 
         *          completed (unlike Thread.Join()), nor a way to get the result. Therefore, ThreadPool is best used for short 
         *          operations where the caller does not need the result.
         *          
         *          6.What are some good to know issues you might encounter when using threads\tasks?
         *              6.*.Deadlock:
         *                  Deadlocks are when two threads\ tasks lock a section\s while remaining dependant in a way that neither
         *                  can unlock and neither can continue their function such that they both remain in a constant state where
         *                  they freeze waiting for the other. Deadlock in short freez the system (in the threads scope and whatever
         *                  is dependant on it)
         *                  
         *              6.*.Starvation:
         *                  Starvation is a situation where the time threads get on tasks it not managed properly and the result is
         *                  that a thread (or a group that does not include all the threads) hogs up all the cpu and "starves" a
         *                  thread, a group of threads or all threads except one. In this case certain actions will not go through
         *                  since they never get cpu time.
         *              
         *              6.*.the for issue
         *                  for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
         *                      doSomething(i);
         *                  }
         *                  In the for loop its easy to see that the once inside two threads can cause one another synchronization
         *                  issues but where does this stem from?
         *                  So the i incrementation is also something thats easy to see but what is even more important is the more
         *                  general i++ rule:
         *                  i++ behind the scenes is translated to:
         *                  j = i + 1
         *                  i = j
         *                  therefore the threads can cause issues inside of the i++ itself and stop anywhere in the sub implementation.
         *                  
         *               6.*.The tasks result async issue.
         *                  When working with tasks there are two methods that might cause issue if invoked with dependancy:
         *                  task t = async task.run;
         *                  v = t.result;
         *

         *                  and the resuly locks the entire thread until it is given its result. A situation can happen where
         *                  the async leaves, the result is requested and locks the thread, when the async returns it tries to enter
         *                  the thread but its locked since the result is waiting for an answer... which is the async, so in fact
         *                  the async will never be able to enter and the result will never open the lock resulting in a deadlock.
